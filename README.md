Welcome to the Automatic Folder Organization Script repository! This script is designed to automate the organization of downloaded files into specific folders based on their file types.

This script scans a specified directory for downloaded files and sorts them into separate folders based on their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos). It identifies file types using their extensions and moves them accordingly.
